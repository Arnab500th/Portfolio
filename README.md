# 🚀 Scrolly Portfolio — Interactive Developer Portfolio

A modern, scroll-driven animated portfolio website built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. 
This project focuses on cinematic scrolling, smooth motion design, and high-performance UI rendering 
to deliver a visually rich and engaging personal brand experience.

The site is designed to present projects, skills, and experience through immersive transitions, 
3D interactions, and canvas-based animation sequences.

# 🎥 Scroll Animation Architecture

This portfolio uses a frame-sequence canvas rendering technique where scroll position directly controls 
which animation frame is displayed. This allows:

- Cinematic storytelling
- Smooth scroll-to-motion mapping
- High-quality visual transitions
- Fine-grained animation control

This approach simulates video-like playback without relying on video formats, improving performance 
and visual sharpness.


# 🧩 UI & Interaction Design

- 3D motion project cards with pointer tracking
- Viewport-based animation triggering
- Gradient + abstract fallback backgrounds
- Dynamic project image rendering
- Smooth opacity + transform transitions
- Motion dampening for mobile performance


# 📬 Contact System

The contact section uses EmailJS to enable secure serverless email delivery directly from the frontend.

- Zero backend required
- Spam-safe template routing
- Secure API handling via environment variables
- Fast global delivery
